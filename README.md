The code consists of various functions and a main loop that together form a recipe management system. Here's a detailed explanation of each part:

1. search_recipes_by_keywords()
This function allows the user to search for recipes using keywords. It checks if any part of a recipe (name, ingredients, or cuisine) matches the input keywords.

Key points:
recipes_db: A hardcoded list of recipes, where each recipe is a dictionary with details like the name, ingredients, and cuisine.

Keyword input: The user enters keywords to search for, which can be multiple and separated by commas. The keywords are converted to lowercase to make the search case-insensitive.

Matching recipes: The function loops through the recipes and checks if any keyword matches the recipe name, cuisine, or ingredients (joined into a single string). It uses the any() function to check if any keyword matches any part of the recipe.

Results: Matching recipes are printed with their name, cuisine, and ingredients.

2. get_valid_input(prompt, allow_numbers=False)
This function is used throughout the program to get user input while ensuring that certain conditions are met. If allow_numbers is set to False, it ensures that the input does not contain numbers.

Key points:
The function loops until the user provides valid input.

If allow_numbers=False and the input contains digits, it will print an error and ask for input again.

The function returns the valid user input.

3. get_allergies()
This function allows the user to select allergies from a list of common allergens. The user can select multiple allergies.

Key points:
allergies: A list of common allergens like nuts, gluten, dairy, etc.

User input: The user selects multiple allergies by entering numbers corresponding to each allergen. The program ensures the input is valid (numbers within the given range).

Returning selection: The selected allergies are returned as a list.

4. get_ingredients()
This function collects the ingredients for a recipe from the user. The user enters ingredients one at a time, and they can finish by typing "done."

Key points:
The ingredients are entered one by one using the get_valid_input() function, which ensures no numbers are included in the ingredient names.

Once the user types "done," the function stops and returns the list of ingredients.

5. get_holiday()
This function asks the user for a Jewish holiday that the recipe is associated with.

Key points:
holidays: A list of Jewish holidays.

The user selects a holiday by entering the corresponding number. The input is validated to ensure it's a valid choice.

The function returns the selected holiday.

6. add_recipe(recipes)
This function allows the user to add a new recipe to the list. It collects various details about the recipe, including the name, origin, cultural background, category, allergies, ingredients, and special instructions.

Key points:
User input for recipe details: The function uses a series of get_valid_input() calls to get the recipe name, origin, and cultural background. The user must choose between "Ashkenazi" or "Sephardi" for the culture.

Recipe category: The user specifies whether the recipe is meat, dairy, or parve.

Holiday and allergies: The user is prompted for the associated holiday and any allergies.

Ingredients: The user enters the ingredients using get_ingredients().

Special instructions: This is a newly added feature where the user can enter any special instructions for the recipe.

The recipe is added to the recipes list as a dictionary containing all the details.

The function prints a confirmation message after successfully adding the recipe.

7. browse_recipes(recipes)
This function allows the user to browse recipes based on their dietary preferences, cultural preferences, and holiday associations.

Key points:
Category: The user selects whether they want meat, dairy, or parve recipes.

Allergies: The function collects the user's allergies via get_allergies().

Cultural preference: The user selects between Ashkenazi or Sephardi recipes, or "Any" if they have no preference.

Holiday preference: The user can choose to search for recipes related to a specific holiday or choose "Any" if no specific holiday is required.

The function then filters the recipes based on these preferences:

The recipe's category must match the user's choice (meat, dairy, parve).

The recipe must not contain any of the user's allergens.

The recipe must match the user's cultural preference (if specified).

The recipe must match the holiday preference (if specified).

Displaying results: The matching recipes are printed along with their details, including special instructions.

8. main()
This is the main loop that drives the entire program. It presents the user with a menu of options and calls the appropriate functions based on the user's choice.

Key points:
Menu options: The user can:

(1) Add a new recipe.

(2) Browse recipes based on preferences.

(3) Search for recipes by keywords.

exit to quit the program.

The loop continues until the user types "exit."

The program calls the respective function based on the user's choice and repeats until the user exits.

Main Program Flow
Inputting Recipes:

The user can input new recipes with all necessary details (name, origin, culture, category, holiday, allergies, ingredients, and special instructions).

Browsing Recipes:

The user can browse through recipes by specifying dietary, cultural, and holiday preferences. The program filters recipes based on those preferences and displays the results.

Searching Recipes by Keywords:

The user can search for recipes by entering keywords (e.g., "chocolate", "Middle Eastern"). The program checks if any part of the recipe matches the keywords and displays the results.

Exit:

The user can exit the program by typing "exit."
